# Analyzing-Job-Data-In-Tableau
When I filtered the job market to only roles where Tableau is a required skill, the results painted a clear picture of how analytics careers are evolving:

📊 Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist positions dominate this Tableau-focused space, with hundreds of active listings.

🛠️ Even within these roles, the skill expectations are broad — some postings require 10–12 technical skills, reflecting how interdisciplinary analytics has become.

📈 Salary growth follows experience closely — starting in the $80K–$100K range and climbing past $200K for seasoned professionals.

📉 Most openings lean toward mid-senior levels, but there’s still room for newcomers at the internship and entry-level stages.

🧭 The career path is well-defined — with experience building progressively from entry-level roles to leadership positions.

The takeaway: Tableau-focused roles are competitive and evolving fast. Success isn’t just about mastering visualization tools — it’s about combining them with a diverse technical toolkit and strategic career planning.
